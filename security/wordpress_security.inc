# Instead of blocking requests with a 403 Denied status, use a redirect to the homepage instead.
# The reasoning behind this is that by returning a 403, we broadcast what is a sensitive file
# which could be used by bad guys to draw conclusions about what kind of CMS or technology we
# are using on this server.  A redirect give a less clear message and keeps our technology more
# obfuscated.  Here we set the 
set $redirect_to $scheme://$host;
